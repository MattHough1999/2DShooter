Welcome! 
To the repository for my 2D shooter
The assets for my game can all be found in the Assets folder.
  This includes any scenes you may wish to access independently of the running game.
To run the game, simply navigate to the "builds" folder and run "builds.exe"
  The game should start immediately and will present you with launch options.
  
----note that certain user interface elements may not display properly on non standard aspect ratios. a 16:9 aspect ratio is reccomended.
